# K-Nearest Neighbor Web App

This is a simple interactive web application that demonstrates the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm visually.

## Features
- Randomly generates a set of points on a 2D plane, each with a random number.
- Click anywhere on the canvas to add a new point. The new point's value is set to the average of its k nearest neighbors.
- Choose k from 3, 5, or 7.
- Reset button to start over with a new random set of points.

## How to Run
1. Open `public/index.html` in your browser.
2. Interact with the canvas and controls as described above.

No backend or build step is required.
